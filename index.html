                <p>Great plot and character design. I'm obsessed with the main song "Golden"; it's a masterpiece!</p>

                <p class="meta">Netflix • ⭐ 5/5</p>
                <p>A tragic story but with a great plot. The lead actress is literally one of the best of the decade; her acting in this movie is just insane!</p>

                <p>This is finally a breath of fresh air for Marvel. The effects and the story are great, and Galactus is such a solid villain!</p>

                <p>The effects are crazy good, but the plot is very similar to the second one. Plus, 3 hours is way too long for me! But overall, it's still a good watch.</p>

                <p>The way the story is told is super new and intriguing. You really have to watch until the very end to get it, though I feel the ending was a bit "meh" compared to the rest of the movie.</p>
